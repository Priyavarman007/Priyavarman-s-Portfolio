# Priyavarman - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Priyavarman! Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong educational background in Computer Science, having earned my Bachelor of Science degree in the field. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a keen interest in leveraging data to derive meaningful insights, which led me to specialize in data analysis.

Check out my projects to see how I analyze data, work with Python and SQL, and create visualizations using tools like Power BI and Tableau. Each project reflects my passion for turning data into meaningful insights!
